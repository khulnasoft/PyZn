## ‚öíÔ∏è Start contributing
I wanted to make the setup of the environment as easy as possible. To start the environment you need the 
following prerequisites:

### Prerequisites
  * bash (+4.3)
  * docker (+17.05)
  * docker-compose (+1.16.1)
  * docker-py (+2.2.1)
  * ansible (+2.3)
  
### Start environment
You only (_fingers crossed_) need to execute the following to start the environment:

```commandline
make start-containers
```

## Architecture and patterns
Principally I used some DDD concepts (like value objects, entities, and so on) and also CQS whose objective is to
separate commands from queries.

The structure of the code is the following:
  * `pyzn/application`: here is where all the commands and the queries are located.
  * `pyzn/domain`: domain objects like entities, exceptions, and value objects.
  * `pyzn/infrastructure`: infrastructure components like the implementation of the repository
    class like DB or BigQuery, the Flask web application, the container, and so on.
    * `pyzn/infrastructure/cli`: the command line programs.
    * `pyzn/infrastructure/container`: config files and the dependency injection manager.
    * `pyzn/infrastructure/api`: the api endpoints controller.
    
## FAQ
**Where the downloads come from?**

The data is retrieved from the official BigQuery repository: https://packaging.python.org/guides/analyzing-pypi-package-downloads/

**When the data is updated?**

There is a cron that runs every day at 5 pm UTC that retrieves all the new downloads from the previous day.
